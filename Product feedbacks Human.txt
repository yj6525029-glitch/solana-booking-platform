Product feedbacks [Human]

- Our goal is to be competitive with traditional booking platforms. We need to cut down our fee by a lot. 80/20 is too much. pretty much the same as booking.com. We want to prove that with automation, costs go low and we can breaking the market standard commission fee. Still want to make money but we are aiming at way lower marging booking then a normal platform.
